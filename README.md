# Task-Management-System

#### Description 
You need to create REST APIs for a simple task management system.
APIs should allow users to perform Sign up/Sign in, CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
Delete) operations on tasks. Each task has a title, description, due date, status (e.g, “in
progress”, “ready for test”, “done), and etc.

### Installation
The project is created with Maven, so you just need to import it to your IDE and build the project to resolve the dependencies

## Usage 
Run the project through the IDE 

or 


run this command in the command line:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
